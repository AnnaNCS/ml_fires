Machine Learning for Environmental Engineering, Fall 2022: Prediction of Western Fires

The following is a project for the Machine Learning For Environmental Engineering and Science course. The data for the project and data processing was 
shared by Caroline Juang.  

In the first part of the project, the code was based on Caroline Jaung's ConvLSTM model. The aim of this section was to optimize the training model of the data to predict the burned area of western fires.
